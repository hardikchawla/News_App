## Project Overview

The goal is to create a News Feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet. In this project, I have used [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch top news headlines from the API. News API is a HTTP REST API for searching and retrieving live articles from all over the web.
The idea is to keep this app super simple which helps the user to use this app easily.
